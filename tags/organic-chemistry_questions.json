If a neutral atom gains an electron it becomes a(n)d) anionGaining an electron results in a once neutral atom having a net negative charge. Negatively charged ions are called anions. 2. The molecule C6H12O6 has what kind of bonding?c) Covalent bondingC6H12O6 contains no ions, making it the perfect candidate for covalent bonding. 3. In an ionic bond, the two atoms have ____________ charges.d) oppositeRemember, ionic bonds are like refrigerator magnets: opposite charges attract. 4. When two non-metals form a chemical bond it is called: d) Covalent bondCovalent bonds occur between nonmetals. Ionic bonds occur between a metal and a non-metal. 5. Which of the following is true regarding covalent bonds?a) They occur between non-metal atoms.b) They result in atoms sharing electrons.c) They result in atoms completing their valence electron shells.d) All of the aboveThis question describes the definition of a covalent bond across three answer choices. Covalent bonds occur between non-metal and non-charges atoms, covalent bonds happen when atoms share electrons, and covalent bonds result in molecules filling their valence electron shell. The Role of Electrons1. Oxygen is a fairly reactive element while Argon is not. This is because:b) Argon has a full valence shell of electronsOxygen needs to gain two electrons to become like the nearest noble gas, neon, with a full octet of electrons. Argon has a full outer shell of electrons, so there's no need for it to react with any other atoms. 2. How many lone electron pairs are in the molecule CH3OH? c) 2A Lewis dot diagram shows that there are 2 lone electron pairs (4 electrons total).3. How many lone electron pairs are in the molecule NH3? b) 1A Lewis dot diagram shows that there is 1 lone electron pair (2 electrons total).4. How many lone electron pairs are in the molecule CO2? e) 4A Lewis dot diagram shows that there are 4 lone electron pairs (8 electrons total).5. How many lone electron pairs are in the molecule C2H4? a) 0A Lewis dot diagram shows that there are no lone electron pairs. 6. Why is the H2 molecule more stable than two separate hydrogen atoms? d) The covalent bonding completes the valence electron shell of the H2 molecule.Alkanes1.
